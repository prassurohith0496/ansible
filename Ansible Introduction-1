ANSIBLE STUDYS:
===============
Chapter-1:
----------
1.1:Introduction:
------------------

- Setup Ansible Lab
- Introduction to YAML
- Inventory files
- Playbooks
- Variables
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Roles

What is Ansible?
----------------
- Ansible is an open source configuration management.
- Ansible can Automate & Standardize the config of remote hosta& vms
- Instead of writting custom scripts, sysadmin create high-level plays in Ansible. A Play performs a series of tasks on the host or group of hosts.
  specified in play . a file that contains one or more plays is called a playbook.

- Ansible Architecture is agentless, work is pushed to remote hosts when ansible executes modules that performs a actual work of the tasks of a play.
- Ansible Comes with hundreads of Modules
- ansible was originally written by "MICHAEL DELTAAN".
Why Ansible?
------------
- Provisioning
- Configuration Management
- Continious Delivary
- Application Deployment
- Security Complience

1.2. Ansible Concepts & Architecture:
--------------------------------------

- Ansible Contains 2 Machines.

1.Control Node.
2.Managed Hosts.

- Ansible software is installed on the controller node
- Managed hosts are listed in a host inventory a text file on the control node that list of managed hostnames or ip addresses.

- system admin login to control node & Launch Ansible & Manage  list of hosts using Playbooks.
- Ansible uses SSH to Communicate Clients.

1.Controller Node Components:
-------------------------------
Ansible configuration: Ansible has config settings that defines how it behaves. These settings include such things as the Remote user to Execute Commands.
----------------------
Host Inventory: - Ansible host Inventory defines which config group hosts belongs to
--------------- - Inventory can define how ansible communicates with a managed host & also defines host & group variable values.

Core Modules: - core modules are modules that come bundled with ansible. there are 400+ Core Modules.
-------------

Custom Modules: - users can write custom modules & add them to library.
--------------- - use shell,Ruby,python etc to Make Custom Modules.

Playbook:  - Ansible PlayBook are files written in YAML. Syntax that define the Modules,with Arguments, To Apply to Managed nodes.
---------  - They declare the Tasks that need to be performed.


Connection plugins: - plugins that enable communication with managed hosts or cloud providers. 
------------------- - these includes SSH & Local.

Plugins: - Extentions that Enchance Ansible Functionality. 
-------- - Controller Node Must Have Python 2.6 or 2.7 Install.
         - for clients  python 2.4 or later
